# Flutter Auto Form

<i>**The easiest way to create fully customizable forms with only a tiny amount of code.**</i>

## Introduction

Are you tired of writing endless lines of code to create forms in your Flutter apps? Look no further! Our Flutter Auto
Form package is here to revolutionize your form-building experience.

Our primary goal is to significantly reduce the amount of code required to create forms in Flutter. We achieve this by
embracing a clear separation of concerns between form logic and form display.

With Flutter Auto Form, you write the form logic in pure Dart, without any direct mention of widgets. Instead, we
introduce the AFWidget, which dynamically renders all the necessary widgets based on a straightforward form
declarationâ€”a simple Dart class that extends the TemplateForm class.

But that's not all! Our package empowers you to design your custom fields and linked widgets, making nearly any form
conceivable. Whether you're working on basic forms or tackling complex ones, Flutter Auto Form has got you covered.

The true magic of Flutter Auto Form shines when you're dealing with multiple forms, especially complex ones. All your
validators are automatically called when you submit a form, and you can even create sub-forms that cascade into one
another.

Dynamic form generation is also feasible but still in experimental mode. It is accessible through the
JsonSchemaForm class.



## Installation

To use this plugin, add `flutter_auto_form` as
a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://plus.fluttercommunity.dev/docs/overview).

<i>pubspec.yaml</i> <br><br>

```yaml

## Support

* Platforms: **All platforms currently supported**
* Autofill hints: **Automatic support through AFTextFieldType**
* Validators: **Email, Url, Hex colour, Not null, Minimum string length, Same as another field, Alphanumeric.**
* Fields: **Password _(auto obscure toggle)_, Text, Number, Model _(built-in support for search through an api)_,
  Boolean, Sub-form _(cascading forms)_, Select _(dropdown field allowing only predefined values)_**
* Custom code: **You can customize and create new fields, validators, widgets as you please without even touching the
  source code of this package !**

## Usage

The first step in creating a form with Flutter Auto Form is to create a class inheriting from the TemplateForm class.

import 'package:flutter_auto_form/flutter_auto_form.dart';

```dart
import 'package:flutter_auto_form/flutter_auto_form.dart';

class LoginForm extends TemplateForm {
  @override
  final List<Field> fields = [
    AFTextField(
      id: 'identifier',
      name: 'Identifier',
      validators: [
        MinimumStringLengthValidator(
          5,
              (e) => 'Min 5 characters, currently ${e?.length ?? 0} ',
        )
      ],
      type: AFTextFieldType.USERNAME,
    ),
    AFTextField(
      id: 'password',
      name: 'Password',
      validators: [
        MinimumStringLengthValidator(
          6,
              (e) => 'Min 6 characters, currently ${e?.length ?? 0} ',
        )
      ],
      type: AFTextFieldType.PASSWORD,
    ),
    AFBooleanField(
      id: 'accept-condition',
      name: 'Accept terms',
      validators: [ShouldBeTrueValidator('Please accept terms to continue?')],
      value: false,
    )
  ];
}

```

The second & (already) last step is to add the AFWidget wherever you would like to display a form.

```dart
AFWidget<RegistrationForm>(
formBuilder: () => RegistrationForm(),
submitButton: (Function({bool showLoadingDialog}) submit) => Padding(
padding: const EdgeInsets.only(top: 32),
child: MaterialButton(
child: Text('Submit'),
onPressed: () => submit(showLoadingDialog: true),
),
),
onSubmitted: (RegistrationForm form) {
// do whatever you want when the form is submitted
print(form.toMap());
},
);
```
## Example

A demo video can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1axi4CSEYflt3oxmnvEI9pIpOMjN4AJD2). The
four forms displayed in the video are all created with Flutter Auto Form, even the model search field.

The source code is located in the example folder.

## Advanced usage

If you need to create your own field (color field, image field, ...) you can always create it by overriding the Field
class. Then to display a custom widget, create a stateful widget that extends the FieldStatefulWidget, and of which the
state extends the FieldState class.
